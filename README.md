# Coursera- Data science specializtion- capstone project

  ###        Now a days people are spending an increasing time on their mobile devices. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain sometimes. 'Swift key', our corporate partner in this capstone,  builds a smart keyboard to make the typing easier. One corner stone of their smart keyboard is 'predictive text models'.
  ### By using some basic Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the knowledge aquired from data science specialization courses, here we built a predictive model algorithm to predict the next word.
  
  ###        To complete this project we performed 8 tasks:  
  #### Understanding the problem, Data acquisition and cleaning, Exploratory analysis, Statistical modeling, Predictive modeling, Creative exploration, Creating a data product and Creating a short slide deck pitching.
  
  ### Mile stone report for this project is in the following link:
  
  ### Shiny Application for this app is in the following link:
  
  ### Source code for the prediction modeling can be found in the following link:
